# üÖ± Features/Integrations

### üßÆ [**Portfolio**](https://blockhead.info/portfolio):
* **Portfolio**: create groups of Ethereum/EVM-based blockchain accounts to see associated token balances, DeFi balances and NFTs across the selected Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains and estimate their crypto net worth.
  * **Add Account**: enter a raw wallet address (`0xabcd...6789`), ENS name (e.g. `vitalik.eth`) or Lens handle (e.g. `stani.lens`), along with one or more supported EVM-based networks.
* **Account**:
  * **Balances**: sort assets alphabetically or numerically, and optionally hide small/irrelevant balances.
  * **DeFi**: view DeFi balances grouped by DeFi protocol (red-colored numbers denote debt/borrowed assets). Optionally show underlying assets backing vaults, liquidity pools, or index tokens.
  * **NFTs**: browse non-fungible tokens and their associated images, grouped by collection (contract). Optionally show their on-chain or off-chain metadata/attributes.
  * **Feed**: optionally show a live activity feed for supported web3 apps.
* **Explore**: Click any address, DeFi app, NFT contract name, ENS name or Lens handle to show more details in [Explorer](https://blockhead.info/explorer) or [Apps](https://blockhead.info/apps).
* **Data transparency**:
  * All data is sourced though data providers defined in Preferences and tagged with corresponding labels and icons throughout the interface.
  * Preferences and portfolio data are saved/cached within your browser's local storage.

### üß≠ [**Explorer**](https://blockhead.info/explorer):
* Explore **blocks** and **transactions** across several **EVM-based blockchain networks**: [Ethereum](https://blockhead.info/explorer/ethereum), [Polygon](https://blockhead.info/explorer/polygon), [Gnosis Chain](https://blockhead.info/explorer/chain), [Arbitrum](https://blockhead.info/explorer/arbitrum-one), [Optimism](https://blockhead.info/explorer/optimism), [Aurora](https://blockhead.info/explorer/aurora), [Avalanche](https://blockhead.info/explorer/avalanche), [BNB Smart Chain](https://blockhead.info/explorer/bsc), [Celo](https://blockhead.info/explorer/celo), [Cronos](https://blockhead.info/explorer/cronos), [Evmos](https://blockhead.info/explorer/evmos), [Fantom](https://blockhead.info/explorer/fantom) and [more](https://blockhead.info/explorer)!

  * The search field query is preserved when switching chains so you can easily look up details for the same address across multiple chains.
* **Address** (externally-owned accounts or smart contracts):
  * **Balances**: native/ERC-20 token balances associated with the address. Click a token to filter for transactions involving that token.
  * **Smart contracts**: browse verified smart contract code from Sourcify (IPFS).
